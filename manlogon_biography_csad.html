    When I was young I didn't care about life and only think about what makes me happy<sup>1</sup>. 
	I like color green but my clothes are mostly blue<sup>2</sup>. I donâ€™t know why, but yeah<sup>3</sup>. 
	I like watching cartoons on the television<sup>4</sup>. My favorite show was tom and jerry<sup>5</sup>. 
	It is very entertaining and fun to watch<sup>6</sup>. I don't really like going to school when I was young<sup>7</sup>. 
	Socializing with other people just makes me tired<sup>8</sup>. I like minding my own business and being alone<sup>9</sup>. 
	After a few months of being in school, I became friends with some of my classmates<sup>10</sup>. 
	I enjoyed having a company for the first time<sup>11</sup>. I had my first bestfriend in school<sup>12</sup>. 
	We played a lot of games and talk about our hobbies<sup>13</sup>. 
	We also helped each other a lot especially on homeworks<sup>14</sup>. 
	I even visited his house for a few times<sup>15</sup>. 
	Becoming friends with my classmates was the highlight of my childhood<sup>16</sup>. 
	I also like to play with my neighbour outside<sup>17</sup>. 
	I remember getting scolded for playing outside until evening<sup>18</sup>. 
	Life was good that time, it was fun<sup>19</sup>. Having friends and playing games was basically my childhood<sup>20</sup>.<br>

    <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	My teenage year was about finding or knowing more about myself<sup>1</sup>. 
	I've changed a lot because of the people around me<sup>2</sup>. I started to like being alone again<sup>3</sup>. 
	Playing games with my phone or watching series was my hobby<sup>4</sup>. 
	It just feels nice and comfortable when you spend your time by yourself<sup>5</sup>. 
	I got to know what I like without faking my personality just to get accepted by others<sup>6</sup>. 
	I was also a student from a christian school which made me know more about God<sup>7</sup>. 
	Every week we have chapel hours and pastors are preching and telling stories from the bible<sup>8</sup>. 
	Most of the stories was interesting and has a lot of lessons to be learned<sup>9</sup>. 
	I became a religious person back then because of my school and my sister<sup>10</sup>. 
	My sister dedicated herself to God that's maybe one of the reasons I became religious too<sup>11</sup>. 
	I also competed with other school back then because I like to solve problems 
	and my teacher said that I should try to compete<sup>12</sup>. 
	I didn't win but it was a great experience<sup>13</sup>. I just like studying and having a good grades 
	when I was a teenager<sup>14</sup>. I was one of the top students on the class<sup>15</sup>. 
	I get sad when my grades are low because I put high expectation on myself<sup>16</sup>. 
	I don't like hanging out as much as I did when I was a child<sup>17</sup>. 
	I like dancing or performing on stages that's why I joined the dance team on my school<sup>18</sup>. 
	It was fun but tiring when we practice<sup>19</sup>. That was my experiences on my teenage years<sup>20</sup>.

	<blockquote><blockquote>COLLEGE YEARS</blockquote></blockquote></h2>
    <div align="justify">
    <p><blockquote><blockquote>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
	When I was about to enter college, the pandemic happened<sup>1</sup>. I stopped going to school for 1 year<sup>2</sup>. 
	I didn't enroll because I was unfamiliar with the online set-up that time<sup>3</sup>. 
	I thought the pandemic would last less than a year, that is why I stopped studying<sup>4</sup>. 
	Then, the next school year the university announced that it would still be online classes 
	that is when I decided to just go with the flow<sup>5</sup>. I enrolled for SY. 2021-2022 on my 
	1st year college<sup>6</sup>. Surprisingly, I find it easy and better than the face to face classes<sup>7</sup>. 
	I liked it because I have more time to do the activities compared to face to face classes<sup>8</sup>. 
	Commuting takes up a lot of time and energy on your daily life<sup>9</sup>. 
	I ride jeepney and LRT2 to get to the university which is around 60-75mins<sup>10</sup>. 
	I don't have to worry about getting up early tomorrow to prepare<sup>11</sup>. 
	I had more time for myself when I was taking online classes<sup>12</sup>. 
	I was really relaxed and calm that time<sup>13</sup>. 
	This has recently changed because the classes are now held in person<sup>14</sup>. 
	Waking up early and going home at night is a struggle<sup>15</sup>. 
	I don't have much time and energy to do the assignments<sup>16</sup>. I'm usually tired and sleepy 
	when I get home<sup>17</sup>. 
	It's really hard when there's a quiz tomorrow but you don't have the energy to study<sup>18</sup>. 
	That is why I always use the weekends to study<sup>19</sup>. 
	I just need to make plans and to manage my time properly so that I can survive the college life<sup>20</sup>.
